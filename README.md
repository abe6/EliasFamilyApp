# Elias Family App
Features include:
* Track the feeding of our pet cat. 
* A shared shopping list.
* A section to leave notes and notices for eachother. 

### What is it?
A small IOS app written in Swift and uses the Amazon Web Service to host a database through their DynamoDB service.
The app can be used to update the time that our pet cat was last fed, update (remove or add items to) the shared family shopping list, or leave a notive/note for the family to read.

### Why did i make this?
This app was my first exposure to Swift, programing for IOS (or mobile at all), use of a database,and use of a web api (to use the database), alot of first. Creating a _good_ app was not the ultimate goal here. I set out to learn new things and thats exactly what i did. The whole project was self-tought through a multitude of online resources. Learning Swift on my own as opposed to a through a class at uni was also an interesting adventure. The other aquired skills like becoming comfortable and familiar with Xcode, the use of databases, api's, Amazon web services, and a many others that made this project so worth while and benefitial. 

This project is certainly not complete and not where id like it to be, however work on it has slowed down due to other commitments.
